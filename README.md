  The industrial talk is about the overview of ICT Jobs in Clarity Techworks. The Clarity Techworks is a Fintech company based in Singapore and Malaysia. The primary product of Clarity Techworks is Rapidz Pay which is a mobile app for cryptocurrency payment and digital assets ecosystem. The industrial talk is led by Mr. Yee Soon Tuck who is the Chief Technology Officer of Claity Techworks and his team. The talk gave me a bunch of benefits where I can get a deeper understanding and information about the working requirements of a company in the future. For instance, I learned that in a software development company, some job scopes play important roles such as Android Developer, UI/UX Designer, QA Testing Analyst, and Junior Web Developer. Besides, I also learned that if I need to engage in an ICT-relevant job, personality traits play a huge role. I need to be a self-learner as todayâ€™s technology keeps changing rapidly and to stay up-to-date on technology trends, I need to keep developing new technologies. From the talk, I got to know that it is crucial for personal and professional growth. 

  In my opinion, the detailed explanations provided by all members of Clarity Techworks enhanced my understanding of the associated ICT job landscape. The talk not only provided valuable insights into the company's operations and products but also changed my perspective on how to become a successful IT worker in the field of technology.
